// Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm implementation as described by Nocedal.
// L-BFGS is an unconstrained quasi-Newton optimization method that uses a limited memory variation
// of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) update to approximate the inverse Hessian matrix.
// The implementation is robust as it uses a simple line-search technique (backtracking in one
// direction only) and still works even if the L-BFGS algorithm returns a non descent direction (as 
// it will then restart the optimization starting from the current solution).
// Its robustness enables it to minimize non-smooth functions, such as the hinge loss.
